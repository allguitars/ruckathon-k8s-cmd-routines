# Linux (Ubuntu)

- To run this script properly, switch to the directory where this file is located and type ``bash do.sh``.

- You can also set an alias to run this script. For example, add the following line into your ``bashrc`` file.

```shell
alias rk8s="bash path/to/srcipt_dir/do.sh"
```

# Windows

- Add the directory where you saved the scripts to the ``PATH`` system variable.

- if you are using **Cmder**, add the following alias to the **Cmder** settings.

```
alias rk8s=sh path\to\script_dir\do.sh
```

Now you can just type ``rk8s`` in **Cmder** terminal to lauch the script no matter which directory you are in.
